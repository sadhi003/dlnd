 I am a Physicist. Currently, my interest is in Data Science, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. I have two parallel thoughts for model building perspective: simulation of a mathematical model and optimization of the proposed model over a large data set. I think more in first perspective 'simulation of a mathematical model' when we are familiar with dynamics of the system under study and explore more in that part where analytical solution does not exist. Here we technically go from model to data generation. The second part 'optimization of the proposed model' comes with machine learning which goes from data to model building (opposite to the first one). Proper feature engineering and tuning of the model parameters are the most important part of the optimization.

***Project 2.*** [***AFinding Donors for CharityML***](https://github.com/Vasuji/MLND-machine-learning-myprojects/blob/master/finding_donors/finding_donors.ipynb): 

Investigated factors that a ect the likelihood of charity donations being made based on real census data. Developed a naive classifier to compare testing results to. Trained and tested several supervised machine learning models on preprocessed census data to predict the likelihood of donations. Selected the best model based on accuracy, a modified F-scoring metric, and algorithm e ciency. [Source Code](https://github.com/Vasuji/MLND-machine-learning-myprojects/tree/master/finding_donors)

***Project 3.*** [***Creating Customer Segments***](https://github.com/Vasuji/MLND-machine-learning-myprojects/blob/master/Customer_segments/customer_segments.ipynb): 

Reviewed unstructured data to understand the patterns and natural categories that the data fits into. Used multiple algorithms and both empirically and theoretically compared and contrasted their results. Made predictions about the natural categories of multiple types in a dataset, then checked these predictions against the result of unsupervised analysis.
