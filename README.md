***Project 2.*** [***AFinding Donors for CharityML***](https://github.com/Vasuji/MLND-machine-learning-myprojects/blob/master/finding_donors/finding_donors.ipynb): 

Investigated factors that a ect the likelihood of charity donations being made based on real census data. Developed a naive classifier to compare testing results to. Trained and tested several supervised machine learning models on preprocessed census data to predict the likelihood of donations. Selected the best model based on accuracy, a modified F-scoring metric, and algorithm e ciency. [Source Code](https://github.com/Vasuji/MLND-machine-learning-myprojects/tree/master/finding_donors)

***Project 3.*** [***Creating Customer Segments***](https://github.com/Vasuji/MLND-machine-learning-myprojects/blob/master/Customer_segments/customer_segments.ipynb): 

Reviewed unstructured data to understand the patterns and natural categories that the data fits into. Used multiple algorithms and both empirically and theoretically compared and contrasted their results. Made predictions about the natural categories of multiple types in a dataset, then checked these predictions against the result of unsupervised analysis.
